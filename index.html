        <p>Donald Ervin Knuth (born January 10, 1938) is an American computer scientist, 
            mathematician, and professor emeritus at Stanford University. 
            He is the 1974 recipient of the ACM Turing Award, 
            informally considered the Nobel Prize of computer science. 
            Knuth has been called the "father of the analysis of algorithms.

        <p>
            Knuth is the author of the multi-volume work The Art of Computer Programming. 
            He contributed to the development of the rigorous analysis of the computational complexity of algorithms 
            and systematized formal mathematical techniques for it. In the process, he also popularized the asymptotic notation. 
            In addition to fundamental contributions in several branches of theoretical computer science, 
            Knuth is the creator of the TeX computer typesetting system, 
            the related METAFONT font definition language and rendering system, 
            and the Computer Modern family of typefaces.

        <br>
        <p>
            As a writer and scholar, 
            Knuth created the WEB and CWEB computer programming systems designed to encourage 
            and facilitate literate programming, 
            and designed the MIX/MMIX instruction set architectures. 
            He strongly opposes the granting of software patents, 
            and has expressed his opinion to the United States Patent 
            and Trademark Office and European Patent Organisation.

            <h2>Biography</h2>
            <p>
                Donald Knuth was born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, 
                to Ervin Henry Knuth and Louise Marie Bohning. 
                He describes his heritage as "Midwestern Lutheran German".
                His father owned a small printing business and taught bookkeeping. 
                While a student at Milwaukee Lutheran High School, 
                Knuth thought of ingenious ways to solve problems. 
                For example, in eighth grade, 
                he entered a contest to find the number of words 
                that the letters in "Ziegler's Giant Bar" could be rearranged to create; 
                the judges had identified 2,500 such words. 
                With time gained away from school due to a fake stomachache, 
                and working the problem the other way, 
                Knuth used an unabridged dictionary and 
                determined whether each dictionary entry could be formed using the letters in the phrase. 
                Using this algorithm, he identified over 4,500 words, winning the contest.
                As prizes, the school received a new television and enough candy bars 
                for all of his schoolmates to eat.
